      <h2 class="h1">Is Trading Suitable for Everyone?</h2>
      <p>For years, I have been sharing my well-detailed trades with anyone interested before I actually execute them.
        This is how those involved can follow my COT strategy.</p>
      <p>But why do so many still fail to achieve my returns? Here are a few key observations to consider before diving
        into the COT strategy</p>

            <h4 class="h4">Wrong Financial Instruments</h4>
            <p>Trading with unregulated products like CFDs or Forex often leads to opaque and costly transactions. It is
              better for beginners to focus on futures contracts, which may offer greater transparency and more
              productive risk management, to benefit from clear pricing structures and better returns.</p>

            <h4 class="h4">Risk Management</h4>
            <p>Protecting your capital and minimizing losses should always be the top priority in trading. Speaking
              about my own experience, my drawdown has never exceeded 10% since 2014, while achieving an average return
              of 77% per year. In my trading courses, you will learn how to patiently wait for a good opportunity and
              when to act decisively within the framework of the available markets.</p>

            <h4 class="h4">Basic Knowledge</h4>
            <p>It is essential to understand how to choose the right futures contract and place bracket orders
              correctly. We offer our members a free basic course to help them learn to trade. Besides, there are plenty
              of other online resources (like the best trading books for beginners) that can guide you if you are new to
              futures trading. Our trading seminars were designed for both beginners and experienced traders alike, and
              these are incredibly useful.</p>

            <h4 class="h4">Searching for the Holy Grail</h4>
            <p>Trying to master every chart pattern, indicator, or optimization technique can make your strategy
              unprofitable. The truth is, that the best trading systems are often the simplest. Using too many
              indicators or making things overly complex can cause you to miss clear trading signals and overcomplicate
              the market.</p>

            <h4 class="h4">Managing Your Emotions</h4>
            <p>Emotions like fear and greed often get in the way of trading success, leading to poor decisions in the
              end. Therefore, both beginners and experienced traders need to stay calm and confident during any online
              procedure. Keeping your emotions in check helps you stick to your strategy instead of reacting impulsively
              to market fluctuations.</p>

            <h4 class="h4">Filling in the Knowledge Gaps</h4>
            <p>inconsistent results often come from a lack of relevant education. If you cannot comprehend futures
              trading, mistakes are inevitable. Good training usually focuses on clear, actionable signals and simple
              strategies, but never overwhelms you with confusing methods.</p>
